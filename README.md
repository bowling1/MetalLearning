# Metal Learning
Looks at how I rate metal albums I've already listened to, then finds albums I'd like from Encyclopedia Metallum.


IDEAS
- Scrape Youtube links from last.fm (names of albums from spreadsheet), then put them in the dataframe to compare with the genre.
- Or.... scrape links directly from youtube, since searching has the namekeys directly in the url.
